## Unit Tests   

The following are the benefits of Apex unit tests:
* Ensuring that your Apex classes and triggers work as expected
* Having a suite of regression tests that can be rerun every time classes and triggers are updated to ensure that future updates you make to your app donâ€™t break existing functionality
* Meeting the code coverage requirements for deploying Apex to production or distributing Apex to customers via packages
* High-quality apps delivered to the production org, which makes production users more productive
* High-quality apps delivered to package subscribers, which increase your customers trust
